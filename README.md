# scriptables
This repo is for all the scripts I write on the Scriptable app. The most recent script will be `recent.js` to maintain easy access, whereas all old scripts will be stored in `scripts/`.

To add a new file, run `bash newScript.sh fileName`
After completing the file, run `bash build.sh fileName` to update recent.js before pushing
